# Bitcoin

This dump contains articles and resources used while setting up my bitcoin and lightning nodes on my raspberry pi

This might contain my wallet.dat file and a couple of other important passwords too.

Don't leave your stuff lying around.

I'm invested in learning the tech more than the cash/bitcoin I can make, for now.

Your priorities might be different. Act accordingly.
