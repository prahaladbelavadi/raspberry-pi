Dump for raspberry pi stuff

This is the first dump.

This involves OS setup and basic node installations and probably some customization in terms of apps.

Nothing important

Has my gmail and a couple of other apps synced

Forgot password.

Dumping it here until I can find a way to figure out the password or basically this is trash
